# Prodromoi
An extensible, cross-platform username search engine. 

Ever get tired of those OSINT challenges where you have to find a social media account with a specific username? Well you've come to the right place! With Prodromoi just run `./Prodromoi <USERNAME>` or `.\Prodromoi <USERNAME>`and find user accounts in less than 20 seconds! No need for any of those username search engines when you can just run 1 command!

To compile and use just clone the repo and run `go build` and you're set! (Or just check the releases page)
